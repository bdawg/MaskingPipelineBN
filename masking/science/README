This directory contains listings of sources observed on
various observing runs, Presently:

Nirc
LWS
Nirc2
Pharo/Palomar


For each instrument, there are two files. eg:

nirc_summary - lists observing runs, gives notes about each
               run, what was observed, who went etc.

nirc_science - gives information ordered by TARGET, not by 
               observing run. If you have a given star
               you are working on, this should list all
               instances of when it was observed.


For nirc and lws generally only the science targets are listed.
(Calibrator observations are only in the paper logs).
For Nirc2 and Pharo, I tried to also include listings of
the cal files. I use the notation cal< and cal> to denote
that the cal belongs to the previous or next star respectively.


%%% To be done: - There is no nirc2_science.txt file written yet
                - Pharo is not up to date with the most recent runs
                - Check with JDM about who has the most up-to-date LWS info
