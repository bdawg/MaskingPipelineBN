Matched filter idlvar files are stored in /home/ben/code/masking/templates/nirc2

Unpack these with scipy to give dictionaries with the following keys:

n_bispect - number of bispectrum points
n_cov - pixels per bispectrum point times bispectrum points = covariance matrix size
v - v coordinate
rad_pixel - plate scale in radians (!)
mf_rmat - accounts for overlapping pixels (should be eye!)
n_baselines - number of baselines
bscov2bs_ix - bispectrum covariance to bispectrum - for every coordinate in the bispectral covariance, this maps it onto the covariance between two particular bispectrum points
mf_ix - matched filter index (goes with mf_pvct and mf_gvct - start and end coordinates of these two arrays for a given baseline, nb there's an extra element holding [0,0] at the end)
bl2bs_ix - baseline to bispectrum index
n_holes - number of holes
hole_diam - size of holes in m
filter - [central wavelength,bandwidth]
bs2bl_ix - bispectrum to baseline index
mf_pvct - all of the pixels corresponding to a particular baseline - trick: label these 0,1 for a binary mask of the pupil
bl2h_ix - baseline to hole index (baseline number, [0,0] first hole first baseline, [0,1] second hole first baseline)
mf_gvct - same as mf_pvct but gives amplitude values (use to weight pixels in fourier plane, g is for gain)
h2bl_ix - hole to baseline index
u - u coordinate
mf_imat - imaginary component of mf_rmat (should be eye or zero)

NB ix = index

there is also a file called 'info_g18.idlvar' etc. This has attributes

b_lengths = baseline lengths
f_cov = fourier coverage
b_angles = baseline angles
xy_coords = xy coordinates
