Pysco stands for Python Self-Calibrating Observables.

It is a python module desgigned to create, extract and manipulate
Kernel-phase data structures, using the theory presented by
Martinache, 2010, ApJ, 724, 464.

The module is constructed around two main classes:
-------------------------------------------------

- KPI: Kernel-phase Information: object that encodes the information
  defined by the linear model for the optical system of interest.

- KPO: Kernel-phase Object: the data structure that, in addition to
  a KPI data structure, also contains Ker-phase data extracted
  from actual images, using the model contained within the KPI object,
  along with some additional information extracted from the data fits
  files headers.

Jan 2013:
--------
Two tryme files are included as part of the original release:
- try_nicmos.py
- try_palomar.py

Of these two, only try_nicmos.py can directly be executed, as the
required data is also included in to this package.
The other script was included for the people collaborating on this
project.
