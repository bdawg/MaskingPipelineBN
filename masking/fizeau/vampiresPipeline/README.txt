This is the reference copy of the VAMPIRES-specific parts of the data reduction pipeline. The idea is to put the *.script files (most importantly proc_vampires.script) in your analysis directory, and edit as needed. These call the .pro files here.

To reduce data and store the ourputs in a csv file, just edit and run proc_vampires.script. However be careful of different eras of data, specifically the Wollaston (one mf file) vs. the Beamsplitter (two mf files) data.
