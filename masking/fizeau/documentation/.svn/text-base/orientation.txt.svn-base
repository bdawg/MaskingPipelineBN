This document describes the orientation of data and images in the
fizeau code.
MJI    06 Jan 2006

---------------------------------------------------------
NB All directions in images (fits files) are when displayed using
IDL, that is, an orientation where (0,0) is in the lower left corner.

1) olog.pa: This is the position angle of vertical (upwards pointing vector)
in the cube file.
2) olog.uflip: If this is set to 1, East is to the left in the
cube file at an olog.pa of 0, if it is set to -1 East is to the right at an
olog.pa of 0, and coordinates will be flipped in the data calibration stage.
3) The orientation of the oifits data (as tested by JDM's binary fitting
routines), the images that come from fred (based on oifits) and the output
from MEMSys all have North up, and East to the left in the image plane.

Specific instruments:
 -See comments in freud.pro for PHARO
 -Note that uflip should be set to -1 in the cube_ script whenever
 required for specific instruments.
