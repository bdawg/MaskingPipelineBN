This Document Describes the variables saved for each cube from
calc_bispect.script
______________________________________________________________
u,v:	The u,v coordinates in wavelengths. These come directly from
        the mf_file so are redundant.
v2:	An n_baselines long vector of V^2 values.
v2_cov: The n_baselines x n_baselines covariance matrix of the V^2 values.
        [convert to standard deviation using e.g.:
          correlation=cov2cor(v2_cov, sig=v2_sig) ]
bs:	A n_bispect long vector of complex bispectrum points.
bs_var: A 2 x n_bispect long array of bispectral variances. The 0th 
        component of each pair is the variance in the amplitude direction, 
        and the 1st component is the variance in the direction perpendicular
        to the amplitude direction. In the case of high signal-to-noise, the
        closure phase variance in radians^2 is given by bs_var[1,*]/modsq(bs)
bs_cov: A 2 x n_cov array of non-zero components of the bispectral covariance 
        matrix. The indexing array bscov2bs_ix determines which two bispectrum
	vectors make up each covariance. The 0th and 1st components of each 
        covariance point are the same as for bs_var.
bs_v2_cov: A n_baselines x (n_holes-2) array of covariances between bispectral
	amplitude and V^2. Only those triangles that contain each baseline are
	included in the array.
avar:	The normalised variance (variance divided by mean squares) in V^2 due to 
	the atmosphere alone (effects of photon and readout noise are removed). An
	n_baselines long vector. See Mike's thesis for why this might be important.
err_avar: Error in avar (an n_baselines long array). For low numbers of frames or
	photon/readout noise dominance, this error can be too large for avar to
	be meaningful. 
phs_v2corr: A correction to V^2 (an n_baselines long array) based on the 
	difference in phase slope across each hole. This correction works
	particularly well for LWS data.
mf_file: The template (matched filter) file used for the analysis.
